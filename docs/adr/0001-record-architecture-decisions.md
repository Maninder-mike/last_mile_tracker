# 1. Use Architecture Decision Records

Date: 2026-02-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to track key architectural decisions, context, and consequences as the project evolves.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document these choices.

## Consequences

- We will have a clear history of *why* decisions were made.
- New contributors can understand the architectural context.
