## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do NOT use the public issue tracker. Instead, please report it via the following process:

1. **Email**: Send a detailed report to <info@maninder.co.in>.
2. **Details**: Include a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and any potential impact.
3. **Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.

Please refrain from disclosing the vulnerability publicly until a fix has been released.
